# Portal Defenders

Made this for the Aavegotchi Game Jam. The idea is that the Aavegotchi are hanging out in their Citaadel and get alerted periodically of an portal under attack. What triggers these attacks? Maybe a real liquidation event? Anyways, a mini portal opens and players rush to enter it with their Aavegotchi as there are only a limited amount of Aavegotchi allowed in. On the other side of the portal, the "lickquidators" are attacking the sources of alchemica. Players must stop them by working together - their Aavegotchis have different attacks depending on their collateral type. When the liquidators reach their goal, the alchemica source takes damage - if all sources are destoyed, the mission is a failure and everyone returns back to the Great Portal empty handed. However, if the players manage to fend off the attack, alchemica rains down and players can collect it and bring it back to the Great Portal where they can use it to craft game-specific NFTs

This was my first time using Moralis and Phaser and I enjoyed working with both. While I wasn't able to realize the idea, it still is a good starting point that might be pretty fun if flushed out more!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
